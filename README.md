## Test a Perceptual Phenomenon, Stroop Effect

This is the project for the statistics course on Udacity. The data itself is about a stroop effect experiment, where people are asked to name a font's color of a word denoting a certain color. The idea is that there might be an inconsistency between the actual color and font color, for example say the word is "Red", but its font color is blue. This paradox between the word meaning and its color often confuses subjects when they are under time pressure, and this confusion is called the stroop effect.

The calculations were done over a spreadsheet, and the pdf file is the final report for the project. It includes a hypothesis testing, descriptive and inferential statistics and a final interpretation for the phenomena.
